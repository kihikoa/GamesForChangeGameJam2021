//Day 1

<<Scene @ outside>>
You walk through the hallways of the school, with your eyes on a book.
<<Act @ Irvin, Irvin>>
Irvin: (I must say, Tolstoy had a gift. The fact that he could make a novel about an adulterous woman interesting is a feat within itself...)

<<Act @ Strange Student, RM1, 1.25, center, #226677>> //RM2
Strange Student: Yo! Y'all need to hear this! Lena is trying to hit on Bobby!
<<Hide @ Strange Student>>
Students run towards the scene. You sigh.
<<Act @ Irvin, 0.75, 0.5>>
Irvin: Of course they would entertain themselves which such frivolous things.
<<Show @ Random Student>>
A student runs into you, making you drop your book.
Irvin: ...!

Random Student: Oops! Did I stop you from enjoying your favorite book?
You pick up the book.

Irvin: It's fine, it's not like I expected any better from you.

You walk away, the student blocks your path.

Random Student: Excuse me?

Irvin: You heard what I said. I know you're not hard of hearing, but maybe I shouldn't assume.

Irvin: Perhaps you're having trouble processing my words, It's not a surprise, The foul music you've been listening to has affected you on a cognitive level. 

Random student raises a hand.

<<Hide @ Random Student>>
<<Hide @ Irvin>>
<<Act @ Mr. Smith, biz-guy>>
Mr. Smith: Is everything alright here, gentlemen?

<<Show @ Random Student>>

Random Student: Yep! I was just asking Irvin about an assignment in one of our classes.
<<Hide @ Random Student>>
<<Show @ Mr. Smith>>

Mr. Smith: Alright then! Goodbye for now Irvin, I'll see you in class!
<<Hide @ Random Student>>
<<Hide @ Mr. Smith>>
<<Show @Irvin>>
Irvin: Likewise.
Mr. Smith leaves and you try walk past the bully,but the stops you.
Irvin: Please don't tell me you're stupid enough to start something a few feet away from a teacher.

Random Student: Look here smarty, just because every teacher loves you and you speak like a snob doesn't mean anything. When I get the chance, I'm going to beat that oreo butt of yours.

Irvin: Whatever helps you achieve that power fantasy.
<<Hide @ Random Student>>
You walk away.

Irvin: (...I hate all of them. I really do.)

<<Scene @ classroom>>
<<Act @ Mr. Smith, biz-guy>>
You enter the classroom. Mr. Smith greets him and he returns the greeting. You sit in your seat as students start to enter the room and take their seats.
The Bell rings. Mr. Smith starts to teach

Mr. Smith: As we can see in this section of the film, Spike Lee is trying to communicate-

The door bursts open to reveal Amandla.

<<Act @ Irvin>>
Irvin: (Oh, of course it's her.)
<<Hide @ Irvin>>
<<Act @ Amandla, Amandla>>
Amandla: Sorry I'm late.

<<Act @ Mr. Smith>> //replace with biz-guy
Mr. Smith: You know my policy Amandla, if you're not in my room by the time the bell rings-

Amandla: Don't bother coming. I know that but-

Mr. Smith: No ifs, ands, or buts. Out!

Amandla: Fine. This class sucks anyway!

<<Hide @ Amandla>>
<<Act @ Irvin, 0.25, 0.5>>

Amandla storms out of the room and slams the door.

Irvin: (I expected nothing less from her.)
<<Hide @ Irvin>>

<<Show @ Mr.Smith, 0.75, 0.75>>
Mr. Smith: When this movie came out, it sparked a controversy that lasts to this day. While it's obvious the police did the wrong thing, who do you believe did the right thing? Did anyone do the right thing in that matter? This isn't something you can look up since everyone has their opinion on the subject. If Lee himself can't give an exact answer for the question, the reviewers can't either.

A student raises her hand.

Mr. Smith: Yes?
<<Act @ Random, Jelani>>

Random: If there's no clear answer, what's the point?
<<Hide @ Random>>
<<Act @ Mr. Smith>>
Mr. Smith: Good question! The point is to start a conversation on what we should for situations like this. There are people who believe the characters were justified in their rioting while others say otherwise. Should everything always be peaceful or should it be peaceful for a certain time?

Mr. Smith: There are people who believe the characters were justified in their rioting while others say otherwise. 

Mr.Smith: Should everything always be peaceful or should it be peaceful for a certain time?

//A few hands go up

Mr. Smith: Don't tell me, but discuss with your group members! I have decided to split the class into 6 groups of 3...

//Irvin's eyes widen
<<Hide @ Mr. Smith>>
<<Act @ Irvin>>
Irvin: (Maybe this won't be so bad...)
<<Hide @ Irvin>>
<<Act @ Mr. Smith>>
Mr. Smith: Group 4 will be Amandla, Irvin, and Jelani...

Irvin freezes.

Irvin: Oh great... A team of people who don't care.

Mr. Smith: Now that you have your groups. You can meet and discuss with each other.

//The bell rings. Irv gathers his things and stands to his feet
<<Hide @ Irvin>>
<<Act @ Jelani, Jelani, , 0.25, 0.5>>
Jelani: Hey Irv!

//Irv looks up to see Jelani running towards him.
<<Act @ Irvin, 0.25, 0.5>>
<<Act @ Jelani, 0.75, 0.5>>
Irvin: Good day to you, Jelani.

Jelani: Aw, thanks! Let's go meet up with Amandla!

//Before he can respond, Jelani drags Irv out the room and they run into Amandla.

<<Act @ Amandla, 0.75, 0.5>>

Jelani: Hey guys! It seems we're working together on the project! Let's do this!

Amandla: Oh cool. What are we doing it on.

Irvin: If you were a diligent student, you would know that we're currently studying the iconic Spike Lee film Do The Right Thing-

Amandla: I'm not stupid. Tell me what the actual project is.

Irvin: We're going to determine if any of the characters did the right thing.

Jelani: Uhhh. It's only one group assignment. Let's do the RIGHT thing by working together!

Irvin: I can tell you who's doing the wrong thing. Anyway, I have to go to AP Physics. If you need to contact me, you can find my email in the school's directory. *leaves*

Jelani: Wait! We haven't discussed our schedules!

Irvin: Then we'll chat after you "break a few ankles" after your basketball practice.
//Irv leaves them
Irvin: (This is going to be a long week...)

<<Show @ Mr.P, biz-guy>>
//<<Act Mr. P, teacher>>

Mr. P: Good day, Irvin!

Irvin: Good day, Mr. P.
<<Act @ Irvin, 0.75, 0.5>>
//Irv notices a stack of papers in his teacher's hands.

Irvin: Is that last week's test?

Mr. P: It is, and as usual, you received the highest grade in the class! Come up for your test!
//Irvin hides a smile. The students around him roll their eyes.
//Mr. P gives him the test. Irv freezes.
Irvin: (An 89?)

//He returns to his seat
Mr. P: Is there something wrong, Irvin?

Irvin: ...Not at all, I was just wondering which questions I got wrong.

Mr. P: You're math was off in the short answers. It was a hard test and I was expecting most to receive a grade between the high 70s and low 80s. You receiving an 89 not only shows your an expert in the subject, but it's the new 100 for the class!

Irvin: I understand. Thank you, Mr.P.

<<Hide @ Mr. P>>

//Irv returns to his seat. He can hear a few students mumble.

//Random: Is he serious upset over an 89?

//Random2: He's one of those dudes that need to be better than everyone. Just look at the way he dresses. It's like he's going to church or something.

//Irv adjusts his blazer and sits down
//Class begins. As the teacher teaches, he keeps thinking about the 89.

Irvin: (Mother and Father aren't going to like this...)
<<Scene @ bg_hallway>>
//The school day goes by. He checks his email but doesn't see anything from Jelani or Amandla.

Irvin: (Imagine being incapable of using an online database.)

//Irv arrives home. Soon his parents come home and it's time for dinner.
<<Scene @ bg_livingroom>>
<<Act @ Mother, Mom>>
Mother: So Irvin, have you received your grade from your AP Physics test?

<<Act @ Irvin>>
Irvin: I did.

<<Act @ Father, Dad>>
Father: And...

Irvin: I received the highest grade.

//His parents smile.

Father: Good!

Irvin: It was an 89.
//Utensils land on the plate. His parents stare at him.
<<Hide @ Irvin>>
Mother: An 89?! What happened?! Did he make a mistake?

<<Hide @ Mother>>
<<Hide @ Father>>
<<Hide @ Irvin>>
<<Act @ Irvin>>
Irvin: No. The test was difficult, even Mr. P admitted it. He wasn't expecting anyone to get a grade higher than the low 80s.

<<Hide @ Irvin>>
<<Act @ Mother>>
<<Act @ Father>>
Father: And now your average is going to drop.

<<Act @ Irvin>>
<<Hide @ Mother>>
<<Hide @ Father>>

Irvin: Actually when it comes to AP classes, you have to multiply the grade you receive by-

<<Act @ Mother>>
<<Act @ Father>>
Father: If you did that, would you have received a 100?

<<Act @ Irvin>>
<<Hide @ Mother>>
<<Hide @ Father>>
Irvin: ...No.

//His father shakes his head.
<<Hide @ Irvin>>
<<Act @ Father>>
Father: Irvin, this is the USA, not the USB+! Your mother and I emmigrated to this country so you could have a surplus of opportunities, and this what you do? If your grades go down, the Ivy Leagues will laugh at your application and you'll be forced to attend some pathetic school like NYU or RIT.

<<Act @ Irvin>>
<<Hide @ Father>>
Irvin: I understand.

<<Hide @ Irvin>>
<<Act @ Father>>
Father: Good. Now go to your room and study. We can't afford to have you make another mistake again.

<<Act @ Irvin, Irvin>>

As you walk down the hall, you see Jelani and Amandla. Jelani waves you over.

Jelani: Hey guys! We have to schedule this meeting sooner than later...

Irvin: Fine. Let's meet in the Library at 3.

Amandla: Wow, everyone's favorite student wants us to be in his presence? This is such an honor!

//Irvin stares at her

Jelani: Okay! What's your email? I couldn't find it in the directory?

Irvin: Irvin@DCSchools.edu. Bye for now.

//Irv leaves for his next class. As he walks, he can barely stay awake.
//He runs into something. When he opens his eyes. It's the student that ran into him yesterday.

//Show tag
<<Act @ Random Student, Random>>
Random Student: Well would you look at that? It's the teacher's pet!
<<Act @ Irvin>>
//Irv rubs his eyes.

Irvin: Just say what you need to say so you can live the power fantasy you keep on thinking about.

//Random gets angry.

Random Student: What did you say?

Irvin: I'm not a fan of repeating myself. Considering getting your ears checked so you can hear me the first time.

//Random raises his hands.

<<Act @ ???, IrvFriend>>

???: Hey! Leave Irvin alone!

//Irv and random see Irv's friend John, standing not too far away.

Irvin: (Ah, John. You're just in time.)

<<Act @ John, IrvFriend>>
<<Hide @ Irvin>>
<<Hide @ Random Student>>

John: Look here buddy, no one wants any trouble! If you lay a hand on him, I'll make sure the teachers will write you so the principal can deal with you!

//Random stands down.
<<Act @ Random Student>>
<<Hide @ John>>
Random: Of course your White pal would show up to save you. I promise you, the next time you do act snarky, it'll be over. See you soon, sellout.

Random walks away. John walks up to Irv.

<<Act @ John>>
<<Hide @ Random>>
John: Are you ok? I got a bit nervous when he started talking to you but it looks like my words made him reconsider!
<<Act @ Irvin>>
Irvin: Yes, they did. Thank you.

John frowns.

John: Is everything ok?

Irvin: Yes. I will see you during lunch.

John nods and they go their separate ways.
//The day goes by and somehow Irv is able to make it to the library.
<<Scene @ bg_library>>

Irvin: (As soon as this thing is over, I'm going to take a nap.)

//He looks at the time. In a few minutes, Jelani and Amandla come In
<<Act @ Jelani>>
<<Hide @ Amandla>>
Irvin: It's good to see you two are on time.

Amandla: What, you expected us to be late?

Irvin: Considering who I'm working with...

Jelani: Be nice. Anywho,  What did you guys think of the movie?

Amandla: Well I thought everyone was justified in their actions. Sal had the right to do what he wants in his place. The people of bed-sty have control of their neighbourhood. The only group of people in the wrong were the cops. ACAB.

Irvin: I believe no one did the right thing. While I agree with Buggin' Out's opinion that the wall should have influential Black figures on the wall and a boycott would be a great solution to this problem, he let his anger cloud his judgment and partnered with Radio Raheem to cause a situation that should have never happened. If Buggin' Out and Sal were able to have a civil conversation with each other, the change would have been made.

Jelani:  Well, it gave me a certain joy when Sal's Place was burned down. I'll say that.  While everyone had some wrong in them, Sal was the most wrong. He caused the most havoc.

They stare at each other.

Amandla: Why am I not surprised about your opinion Irvin. What would a goody 2 shoes like you understand about struggle, huh? You don't understand how us measly regular people experience the world and I don't know if you ever will.

Irvin: Just because I have a standard and a reputation to uphold, doesn't mean I don't understand struggle. In fact, being your babysitter for these next few days is worth a decade of struggle!

Amandla: You'll never understand what it's really like to be black. You'll never understand what people like Jelani and I go through. We don't adapt ourselves and change to be "proper". Proper to who? We all know who.

Irvin: *chuckles* The fact that you think I'm trying to please the "White man", then that tells me everything I need to know. You have such low standards for Black people that you think me being me means I want to be White! Is that why you act like a reject? You think you're helping our people by being a deliquent?

Amandla: Oh you think you know me. You think you know me! You don't. You'll know my fist pretty well if you keep talking though. So go ahead, keep talking.

Jelani: Irvin, you have been working my nerves all day. The way you have talking to us is out of pocket. I get it. You are feeling a lot of pressure, but there's no reason for you to be looking down on others like that.

Amandla: See Irvin. Even Jelani, the worlds kindest athlete, thinks that you're a pompus prick.

Jelani: You're about to see a different person today. Amandla, you are just as problematic. It's insulting you would sit here at tell another black person that they don't struggle.

Amandla: Well aren't you a walking talking stereotype. Sports, really? Trying to be the next unproblematic Serena Williams are we?

Jelani: Weren't you late yesterday? I got time today. I wasn't going to say anything, but you aren't that smart, you're failing your classes, and nobody likes you. I tried to be your friend, but you don't deserve it dummy.

Irvin: At least someone here has sense!

Jelani: Don't speak. Your mouth has been spewing nothing but nonsense the past hour. I'm not about to do this. I'm out.

<<Hide @ Irvin>>
<<Hide @ Amandla>>
<<Scene @ bg_hallway>>
You gather your things and leave, fuming.
Irvin: (How dare those two speak to me that way? They had the audacity to say I was being "out of pocket". If I was "out of pocket", they were out of their minds! And the audacity for that tardy pariah to call me "White"? Despicable! Imagine being livid by someone being themselves instead of blending in with the hivemind!) 

//Irv spots a a bulletin board with papers on it. He grabs one of the papers, crumbles it up, and throws it at the ground.
//A few seconds pass. Sighing, he picks it up and throws it in the garbage.

Irvin: (There's no need to go ballistic, Irvin. That would bring those two fools pleasure. Take a deep breath and calm down...)
//Irv returns home. He goes into his room and jumps into bed.
<<Scene @ bg_bedroom>>
Irvin: (As much as I would love to forget about them. I can't afford to when I have a grade on the line...)

//He rolls over.

Irvin: (I'll worry about that later. For now, It's time for a quick nap.)

John: Hey Irvin... is everything ok? You look angry!

Irvin: I would be lying if I said I was ok. I'm having a squabble with my group mates for Mr. Smith's class.

John: Really? What happened?

Irvin: Let's just say Miss Punky Reject had a few words about me while Miss "Hiyeeeeeee!" corraborated her statements.

John: Really? Are you sure you weren't being a bit harsh with them?

Irvin: I don't see why that would-

//John stares at him

Irvin: ...Perhaps. I didn't sleep that night since my parents wanted to test me on the material I studied.

John: You failed a test?!

Irvin: Yes. I received an 89 on the Physics test.

John: Wasn't that the highest grade?

Irvin: Yes, it was.

//John frowns

Irvin: Don't pity me, John. I'm not a beaten puppy.

John: I'm not pitying you! You're my friend, I care about you! Honestly, I think you should apologize and tell them that you had a bad day.

Irvin: Me? Apologize?

John: Yes! Unless you want to tell your parents that you got a 0 due to an argument with your group members, you have no choice!

Irvin: I'm not going to apologize to the duo that spat on my identity and personality! They'll need to apologize to me!

John: But your grade-

Irvin: I'll ask Mr. Smith for a last minute adjustment. I'm one of his favorite students, I'm sure he'll make the change.

Plus, I believe that you can rub off on Amandla and turn her from a rebel to a good student. Believe it or not, I care about her wellbeing to an extent.

John: Irvin, I know you're embarrassed but hiding out in the library isn't going to help. You have a few more classes left in the day!

Irvin: I'm aware and I don't care. I just want to disappear for a few minutes and find comfort in a good book.

As you walks through the library, You spot Amandla eating lunch. You about to roll your eyes until spots the book in her hand.

Irvin: (My goodness... she's reading Tolstoy!)

You rubs your eyes and stare at the book again.

John: Irvin, are you tired?

Irvin: No, I thought I was seeing things. Let's find a table to eat before it's too late.

The final bell rings, and everyone starts to leave their classrooms.

You walk down the hall, reading the book in your hand, ignoring the noise around you.

Two familar figures approach you. You look up to see Jelani and Amandla. Before you can speak, Jelani cuts you off.

Jelani: We're here to apologize for what we said to you! Even though you're really condescending, it's clear that you get it from your mom!

Irvin: Excuse me?

Amandla: Wow Jelani! Going in for the kill!

Jelani: No! I meant... well.. I saw your mother talking to one of your teachers the other day and it didn't look pretty and you looked really sad and-

Irvin: What are you trying to say?

Amandla: She's trying to say you treat others the same way your mom treats you. You should work on it so you can be likeable.

Irvin: That's foolish. My parents only wants what's best for me.

Jelani: By making you retake a test or take a harder test after forcing you to study all night?

Irvin: ...

Irvin: I see your point.

Amandla: You should put your foot down and show your parents who's boss!

Irvin: No no. I don't want my parents to disown me.

Irvin glares at Amandla.

Irvin: ...And I wouldn't follow any of the advice you gave me.

Jelani: Irv!

Amandla: Don't worry, Jelani. He has the right to be angry. Irv, I'm sorry for calling you a sellout. I wanted to piss you off and while I was successful, it was wrong.

Amandla: Don't get me wrong, you're still weird since you talk like you're some snobby billionaire and probably listen to Beetoven-

Irvin: I'm more of a Percy Grainger man-

Amandla: Don't care. Anyway, you look happy being this high-standard kid, so enjoy it. It's your life.

Irvin: ...I must say I wasn't expecting that. Thank you, Amandla.

Irvin: I know my tongue can get me into trouble, and I'm sorry for insulting you the both of you, especially you Amandla. 

Irvin: I may not understand your style or attitude but... it suits you and those like you.

Amandla: Thanks!

Jelani: With that being said, let's get started with our project!

Mr. Smith: You're welcome! You know... I think you three can be best friends if you spend more time with each other.

Jelani smiles.

Jelani: You have a point Mr. Smith! Do you guys want to get pizza?

Amandla: Hell yeah I'm down.

Irvin: Pizza is too greasy. We can go to the local cafe for healthier options.

Jelani and Amandla stare at you.

Irvin: Fine. We can get pizza. I hope it doesn't dirty my clothes.
