//Day 3
<<Scene @ bg_hallway>>
//Refreshed, Irvin walks through the halls. Going though the usual motions of his school day.
//When he enters his math class, he sees Amandla sitting in the desk behind his.
<<Scene @ bg_classroom>>
<<Act @ Irvin>>
<<Act @ Amandla>>

Irvin: (She's actually arrived before I did. Either she's fixing her actions, or she's already rubbing off on me.)
//He cringes at the thought
Irvin: (Godforbid the latter.)
//He ignores the tension and sits in his seat.
<<Hide @ Amandla>>
//The class starts. He starts taking notes. As he writes, he hears a paper being ripped up and crumpled behind him.

Irvin: (3... 2... 1...)

//Something hits his back. He rolls his eyes and continues to write.
//The bell rings and Irv walks towards the band room.
<<Scene @ bg_hallway>>
//As he walks towards it, he sees Jelani running down the hall with her gym uniform on.
<<Hide @ Irvin>>
<<Act @ Jelani>>
//They glare at each other as they cross paths.
//Once she's gone, he exhales and enters the band room.
<<Scene @ bg_classroom>>
//John spots him and waves him over!
<<Act @ Irvin>>
<<Act @ John>>
John: Hey Irvin... is everything ok? You look angry!

Irvin: I would be lying if I said I was ok. I'm having a squabble with my group mates for Mr. Smith's class.

John: Really? What happened?

Irvin: Let's just say Miss Punky Reject had a few words about me while Miss "Hiyeeeeeee!" corraborated her statements.

John: Really? Are you sure you weren't being a bit harsh with them?

Irvin: I don't see why that would-

//John stares at him

Irvin: ...Perhaps. I didn't sleep that night since my parents wanted to test me on the material I studied.

John: You failed a test?!

Irvin: Yes. I received an 89 on the Physics test.

John: Wasn't that the highest grade?

Irvin: Yes, it was.

//John frowns

Irvin: Don't pity me, John. I'm not a beaten puppy.

John: I'm not pitying you! You're my friend, I care about you! Honestly, I think you should apologize and tell them that you had a bad day.

Irvin: Me? Apologize?

John: Yes! Unless you want to tell your parents that you got a 0 due to an argument with your group members, you have no choice!

Irvin: I'm not going to apologize to the duo that spat on my identity and personality! They'll need to apologize to me!

John: But your grade-

Irvin: I'll ask Mr. Smith for a last minute adjustment. I'm one of his favorite students, I'm sure he'll make the change.
